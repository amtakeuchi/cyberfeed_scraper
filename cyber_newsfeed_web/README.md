This is a tool I made using Python, HTML, and CSS to scrape several sources of news and information in various categories.

By gathering these feeds, then allowing for use of keywords to search through titles and content, I made reading up on news and staying informed much easier. 

This tool is launched on your local device and, after a little time to gather everything, allows you to browse through all your news in one place, instead of needing to go to several sources to read. 

There are a couple bugs due to some sources not exposing their public RSS feeds anymore, but you can still read the title fine and click to read the full article on the site itself.
