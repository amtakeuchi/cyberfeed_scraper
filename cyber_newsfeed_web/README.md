ðŸ“¡ Cybersecurity & Financial Threat Intelligence Aggregator (Flask Web App)
Description:

This is a custom-built Flask web application designed to aggregate and surface the latest headlines and alerts from across the cybersecurity, finance, cryptocurrency, geopolitics, crime, and world news ecosystems. It serves as a centralized dashboard for monitoring breaking news, active cyber threats, financial market movements, and geopolitical events relevant to incident response, penetration testing, cloud infrastructure security, and strategic risk monitoring.

What It Does:
-Aggregates and filters content from multiple public RSS feeds and direct HTML scrapes.
-Surfaces high-priority articles containing keywords relevant to cybersecurity operations, financial risk, and geopolitical intelligence.
-Caches feed results to improve performance and reduce rate-limiting issues.
-Fetches content asynchronously using Pythonâ€™s ThreadPoolExecutor for faster, non-blocking updates.
-Integrates live content from Bloombergâ€™s Markets, Technology, Crypto, and World News sections via custom-built web scrapers.

ðŸ”§ Key Features & Technologies:
-Python (3.12)
-Flask web framework for handling routing, rendering, and server-side logic.
-Feedparser for parsing traditional RSS and Atom feeds.
-Requests + BeautifulSoup for HTML web scraping (Bloomberg and other non-RSS content).
-Flask-Caching to reduce redundant requests and speed up page loads by caching fetched articles for 10 minutes.
-Asynchronous fetching with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor to parallelize feed and scraper requests without blocking the web server.
-Dynamic filtering using a configurable keyword list tailored for roles like:
  -Cybersecurity Incident Responders
  -SOC Analysts
  -Penetration Testers
  -Cloud Engineers
  -System Hardening Specialists
-Categories and tagging system to group articles by their source domain (e.g. Cybersecurity, Finance, Crypto, World News, Geopolitics, Crime).

ðŸ’¡ Why I Built It:
As someone working toward roles in cybersecurity operations and cloud security, I needed a practical tool that consolidates real-time, actionable threat intelligence and market signals in one place. Public RSS feeds alone werenâ€™t enough, so I integrated direct web scraping for sites like Bloomberg, which removed public RSS endpoints for key sections.

This app is now a personal, always-on tool for daily monitoring of global developments that could affect cloud infrastructure security posture, cyber incident readiness, financial risk assessment, and geopolitical threat mapping.

ðŸ“Š Example Use Cases:
-Spotting new zero-day exploit disclosures or nation-state attack attributions within minutes of publication.
-Monitoring Bloomberg Markets and Crypto sections for financial market events linked to cybercrime (like crypto laundering or stock market DDoS extortion schemes).
-Tracking law enforcement actions and major cybercrime arrests via FBI and DOJ press releases.
-Watching for geopolitical conflicts and their potential impact on cloud services, VPN infrastructures, and internet backbone reliability.

ðŸ“Ž Future Improvements:
-Integrating Redis-backed persistent caching.
-Adding email alerting or webhook-based notifications.
-Deploying as a Dockerized container in AWS ECS or Azure App Service.
-Building a lightweight frontend search/filter UI with sorting by keyword or category.
